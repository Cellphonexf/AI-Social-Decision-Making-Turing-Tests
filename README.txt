##AI vs. Human Rationality in Social Decision-Making: Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Predict Human Behavior##

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our research project. This repository contains the code and data used in our study.

##Data and Code Usage##

##Study 1##

Data: rawdata_study1.xlsx, scenario_study1.xlsx, Plotting_WithinGroup.xlsx
Script for Analysis: Study1_WithinAnalysis_framing.R, Study1_WithinAnalysis_scenario.R, Study1_BetweenAnalysis_HvsAI.R, Study1_BetweenAnalysis_GPT4vs3.5.R 
Script for Viso: WithinAnalysis_Viso1.R

- Run the script segment by segment to follow each step of our analysis
- Output results are stored in folder 'Outputs_study1'
- Generated graphs: WithinViso1.pdf
- Final figure: Fig. 1 (refined using Adobe Illustrator)

##Study 2##
